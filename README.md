# Climbing-Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

The solution would using a recursion that works top down solving the problem especially with recursion that involve calculations. We will have to add
a base case though to start with.
